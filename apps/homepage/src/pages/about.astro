                        I started in web and software development about a decade
                        ago, never planning on it being my career and passion. I
                        started out with WordPress websites for non-profits and
                        friends' side-projects, left my previous career to take
                        a 12-week bootcamp, and now I'm a full-stack developer
                        and team manager. I've worked with legacy codebases,
                        been the lead backend developer as our team built a
                        brand-new web application, and even managed to learn to
                        love SQL.

                        I have an B.Sc. in Ecology. I attended RED Academy in
                        Vancouver, finishing as the top student in the Front-End
                        Web Developer Professional Program. I also have taken a
                        6-month Leadership Coaching Program.

                        I'm primarily a full-stack javascript developer, with a
                        focus on Node.js APIs. I've built RESTful APIs, GraphQL
                        APIs, tRPC-esque APIs and many serverless systems. I've
                        worked with a variety of front-end frameworks, but I'm
                        most comfortable with React. Databases-wise, I currently
                        work with PostgreSQL, BigQuery, and Redis. I've got
                        fairly extensive experience with Google Cloud Platform,
                        mainly Cloud Run, Cloud Run Functions, and Scheduled
                        Jobs. I've also worked with AWS, mainly Lambda and
                        ElasticBeanstalk. I've configured Docker containers,
                        written deployment scripts in bash, and CI/CD pipelines
                        with GitHub Actions.

                        I'm very comfortable working with geospatial data,
                        manipulating complex timeseries data,
