Whale Tales is a project I co-founded with my two best friends. We host a living library of over 1500 stories about whales, dolphins and porpoises from around the world.

I designed and built out all the various implementations of our website over the years. The current implementation is a WordPress site with some custom-built plugins to help handle the tags and categories.

We also have a podcast, and use WordPress to generate the RSS feed.

This project might not have that much technical relevance to what I now do professionally, but I think I'll always include it in my portfolio for a few reasons:

**1. To remember how far I've come:**

This website and ones like it were how I first taught myself about web development, and were my gateway into a career in software.

**2. Mainainable products are really important to me:**

The first few iterations of whale-tales.org were all about building a custom theme, learning more and more about WordPress. But as my career has evolved, I'm more focused on other tech stacks and opportunities. The site is now built with almost all drag-and-drop WordPress block-builder components, with just a few lines of custom code. It's so much more maintaintable and sustainable to keep working on this site now that it's easy to keep up-to-date with WordPress releases. Choosing the right technology for the project is always a big discussion, and in the case of a side project, no less relevant to consider
